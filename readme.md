# What am I?

This is a simple interactive "widget" designed as embed for McClatchy properties.

## How to use and istall

### What'll you need

* **Yarn** (important)
* [Blendid](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid)   
    * Uses Yarn
* jQuery
* Pym.js
* DataTables
* Leaflet

All these are included in `package.json`.

Once you get Blendid set up with the rest of the packages, simply run `yarn run blendid` and you'll be good to go.

ESLint, of course, is optional.
